</h4>Tarun Rayavarapu</h4>
###Period 2

**About Me**
My name is Tarun Rayavarapu and I am 15 years old. I took this class because both of my parents are software engineers, and very much enjoy their time in it. I also took this class because I want to learn coding and coding is the future of our world. I'm really interested in technology and thought this class would give me a good foundation for understanding it better. Also, I know that computer science is an important skill for many careers, so I thought it would be useful for my future. Lastly, I wanted to challenge myself with a more advanced class to see if I could handle it.
