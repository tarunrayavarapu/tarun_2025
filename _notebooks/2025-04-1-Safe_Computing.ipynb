    "1. **Check the Sender** – Is the email from an official bank address? Look for misspellings or strange domains.  \n",
    "2. **Look for Red Flags** – Does the email create urgency or threaten account closure? Scammers use fear to trick people.  \n",
    "3. **Hover Over Links** – Without clicking, hover over the link to see where it actually leads. Fake sites often look real.  \n",
    "4. **Check for Typos & Weird Formatting** – Official emails are usually well-written. Strange grammar or fonts can be a warning sign.  \n",

    "- **Don’t Click Any Links** – They could steal your login info.  \n",

    "- **Change Your Password** – If you already clicked the link, change your bank password immediately.  \n",
