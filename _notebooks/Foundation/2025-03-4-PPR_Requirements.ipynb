Selection is used with the if (!response.ok) statement, which checks if the response is successful; if not, it throws an error to stop the process and jump to the catch block.

Together, these elements ensure the function efficiently retrieves, verifies, and processes data while managing potential errors."

    "In my blog post about PPR requirements, I explained some key programming concepts in my food review application. I started by describing a get() method that gathers reviews and user details from a database, turning each review into a dictionary and adding it to a list called review_list. I also talked about a JavaScript line that uses .forEach() to loop through the reviews and create cards for each one. I explained how my fetchReviews() function fetches data, checks if it's successful, and then uses .forEach() to display the reviews. Lastly, I mentioned how I used document.addEventListener() to make sure reviews load properly when the page opens."
