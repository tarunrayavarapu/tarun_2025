This was also an issue of missing our scrum leader at beginning of Sprint, so caused some issues.           |\n",

This is why I gave it this grade.   https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csp/big-idea/p2/3-6      |\n",
    "| Homework, Popcorn Hacks    | 1 x 6         |      0.88     |   I put a lot of effort in the homework hacks for 3.7 and the popcorn hacks for 3.7, and revised them many times. I also went over 3.6's popcorn and homework hacks too, and improved on them. One flaw in this was that one of our popcorn hacks had unfamiliar javascript code, which was not able to run on some peoples vscode, which hindered this grade a little a bit.   https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csp/big-idea/p2/3-6-2 https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csp/big-idea/p2/3-7-2         |\n",

Just like the other problems, I had a little bit of a kasm issue when we started, but it was resolved quickly. My 0.89 comes from the fact that I did most of the work for my 3.7 part, but I also didn't do much at the start.             |\n",

We also made our planning on a different portfolio because we had a different scrum master at the time, and we did had to refork a different portfolio with a different scrum master    https://github.com/VincentH14/sprint2_2025/issues/1    |\n",
