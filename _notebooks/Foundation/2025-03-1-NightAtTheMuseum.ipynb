People rated the attractiveness of our website lower, which means our styling might not have been the best. Since this is my job as a UX engineer, I could have defitenely improved on this to make the website look nicer. Our user-friendliness and uniquess were also a little lower than purpose, which could be due to our simple idea. Although we had great reviews, there were still areas to improve on.\n",
