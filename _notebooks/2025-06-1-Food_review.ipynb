    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for restaurants.\n",
    "- **Integration**: My first attempt at full-stack development.\n",
    "- **Output**: Reviews and ratings displayed dynamically on the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges Faced:\n",
    "- **Starting from Scratch**: Coming off a bad project in the previous trimester, I had no prior experience with frontend, backend, or full-stack development.\n",
    "- **Learning Curve**: I had to teach myself everything from setting up a backend API to integrating it with the frontend.\n",
    "- **Unpolished Feature**: While the feature works, it lacks the polish of a more experienced developer's implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Frontend**: Simple HTML and JavaScript for user interaction.\n",
    "- **Backend**: Flask API to handle review submissions and retrievals.\n",
    "- **Database**: Stores reviews and ratings for each restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Input (Review + Rating) --> Frontend --> API Gateway --> Flask App -->\n",
    "  - Store in Database\n",
    "  - Retrieve and Display Reviews\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "- **User Review Submission**:\n",
    "  - Users can leave a review and a star rating (1–5) for a restaurant.\n",
    "- **Review Display**:\n",
    "  - Reviews are displayed dynamically on the frontend, allowing users to see what others have said.\n",
    "- **Backend Integration**:\n",
    "  - Reviews are stored in a database and retrieved via API endpoints.\n",
