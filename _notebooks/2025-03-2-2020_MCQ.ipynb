    "I noticed that I got many questions wrong because I misinterpreted Boolean logic, misunderstood how certain algorithms execute, and rushed through some of the wording. For Boolean questions, I need to slow down and break down conditions step by step instead of assuming how they work. When dealing with code execution, I should trace through loops and functions with sample inputs to catch errors like resetting variables incorrectly or failing to handle edge cases. In math-based questions, like binary representation, I need to apply formulas instead of estimating answers. Lastly, I should take a little more time reading carefully, especially for trick questions, to avoid missing key details. By focusing on these areas, I can improve my accuracy and avoid making the same mistakes."
