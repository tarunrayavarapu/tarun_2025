    "# ‚ö° Project Log: Building an Automatic Room Light Controller (Arduino + PIR Sensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìñ Why I Picked This Project  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I‚Äôm getting into electrical engineering, I wanted to build something simple, useful, and beginner-friendly to learn about sensors and circuits. I didn‚Äôt have much money to spend, so I looked for a project under $25.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After some research, I decided to make an **Automatic Room Light Controller** ‚Äî a device that turns on a light when it detects motion and turns it off after a few seconds. It‚Äôs perfect for learning about sensors, relays, and basic coding with Arduino.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéí Parts I‚Äôm Using  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Part | What It Does | Price |\n",
    "|:-------------|:--------------------------------|:------|\n",
    "| Arduino Uno Clone | The microcontroller (brain of the project) | ~$9 |\n",
    "| PIR Motion Sensor | Detects motion using infrared | ~$3 |\n",
    "| 5V Relay Module | Acts as a switch to control the light | ~$3 |\n",
    "| Jumper Wires + Breadboard | Connects everything together | ~$7 |\n",
    "| 9V Battery + Holder (optional) | Power supply without USB | ~$3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Tools I‚Äôm Using  \n",
    "- Computer with Arduino IDE installed  \n",
    "- USB cable for Arduino  \n",
    "- Small screwdriver (for relay terminal screws)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìê Step 1: Understanding How It Works  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** When the motion sensor detects someone in the room, the relay will turn on and power a light. After a short delay, it turns off automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PIR Sensor:** Detects movement based on infrared radiation.\n",
    "- **Relay Module:** Acts like a remote switch ‚Äî lets a low-voltage circuit control a high-voltage device (like a light).\n",
    "- **Arduino:** Reads the sensor signal and tells the relay when to turn on and off.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Installing the Arduino IDE  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  \n",
    "2. Install it like any normal program  \n",
    "3. Plug in your Arduino using a USB cable  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Step 3: Wiring Everything Up  \n",
    "\n",
    "**I started by connecting the PIR sensor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| PIR Sensor Pin | Arduino Pin |\n",
    "|:---------------|:------------|\n",
    "| VCC | 5V |\n",
    "| GND | GND |\n",
    "| OUT | Digital Pin 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then I connected the Relay Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Relay Module Pin | Arduino Pin |\n",
    "|:----------------|:------------|\n",
    "| VCC | 5V |\n",
    "| GND | GND |\n",
    "| IN  | Digital Pin 3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relay to Load (for demo I used a small LED + resistor, but you can connect a 5V bulb too):**\n",
    "- One side of the LED circuit connects to **COM**\n",
    "- Other side connects to **NO (Normally Open)**  \n",
    "- When relay turns on, it completes the circuit and turns the light on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** I used a breadboard to connect the jumper wires and tested each connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíª Step 4: Writing and Uploading the Code  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs the exact code I wrote and uploaded to my Arduino:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int pirPin = 2;\n",
    "int relayPin = 3;\n",
    "\n",
    "void setup() {\n",
    "  pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);\n",
    "  pinMode(relayPin, OUTPUT);\n",
    "  digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW); // Keep light off by default\n",
    "  Serial.begin(9600);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void loop() {\n",
    "  int val = digitalRead(pirPin);  // Read PIR sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "  if (val == HIGH) {  // If motion detected\n",
    "    digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH);  // Turn relay (and light) ON\n",
    "    Serial.println(\"Motion detected, light ON\");\n",
    "    delay(5000);  // Wait 5 seconds\n",
    "    digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW);  // Turn light OFF\n",
    "    Serial.println(\"Light OFF\");\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",

    "## üéõÔ∏è Step 5: Testing It  \n",
    "\n",
    "I moved my hand in front of the PIR sensor ‚Äî and saw the light turn on for 5 seconds, then turn off. The Serial Monitor also printed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Motion detected, light ON\n",
    "Light OFF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**It worked perfectly on the first try.**  \n",
    "If it didn‚Äôt, I would‚Äôve:\n",
    "- Double-checked connections  \n",
    "- Made sure sensor pins were correct  \n",
    "- Re-uploaded code  \n",
    "- Checked the PIR sensor‚Äôs sensitivity dial (it has a tiny potentiometer for range)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÑ What‚Äôs Next / Improvements I‚Äôll Try  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** so the light only turns on if it‚Äôs dark.  \n",
    "2. **Use a real bulb** controlled through a power-rated relay.  \n",
    "3. **3D print or build a small case** for it.\n",
