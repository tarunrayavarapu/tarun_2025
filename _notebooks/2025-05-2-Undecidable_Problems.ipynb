    "Another Undecidable Problem: Post Correspondence Problem (PCP)\n",
    "The Post Correspondence Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem. It works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two lists of strings, A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each position i in both lists corresponds to a pair: A[i] and B[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "- The task is to figure out if there's a sequence of indices (like 1, 3, 2...) such that when you concatenate the strings from list A in that order, it equals the concatenation of the strings from list B in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it undecidable?\n",
    "- There’s no general algorithm that can always tell you for any given set of string pairs whether such a sequence exists. For some cases it can be solved, but for others, it can't — and no program can decide this for all possible inputs."
