<h1>AP Computer Science Principles</h1>

**Tarun Rayavarapu**

**Period 2**


<h2>About Me/Why I Took This Class:</h2>


My name is Tarun Rayavarapu and I am 15 years old. I took this class because both of my parents are software engineers, and very much enjoy their time in it. I also took this class because I want to learn coding and coding is the future of our world. I'm really interested in technology and thought this class would give me a good foundation for understanding it better. Also, I know that computer science is an important skill for many careers, so I thought it would be useful for my future. Lastly, I wanted to challenge myself with a more advanced class like this class to see if I could handle it.
